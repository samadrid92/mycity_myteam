      <h3><%= @team.team_name %>'s History</h3>
      <p>In the 20th century, the team, then known as the Robins, won league pennants in 1916 and 1920, losing the World Series both times, first to Boston and then Cleveland.
         In the 1930s, the team changed its name to the Dodgers, named after the Brooklyn pedestrians who dodged the streetcars in the city.[4] In 1941, the Dodgers captured
         their third National League pennant, only to lose again to the New York Yankees. This marked the onset of the Dodgersâ€“Yankees rivalry, as the Dodgers would face them

      <h3>Dodger Stadium</h3>
      <p>Dodger Stadium, occasionally called by the metonym Chavez Ravine, is a baseball park located in the Elysian Park neighborhood of Los Angeles, the home field of the Los Angeles Dodgers, the city's Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise. Opened 54 years ago on April 10, 1962, it was constructed in less than three years at a cost of $23 million, financed by private sources.
          Dodger Stadium is currently the third-oldest ballpark in MLB, after Fenway Park in Boston (1912) and Wrigley Field in Chicago (1914) and is the largest MLB stadium by seat capacity. Often referred to as a "pitcher's ballpark", the stadium has seen 12 no-hitters, two of which were perfect games.The stadium hosted the Major League Baseball All-Star Game in 1980,
          as well as games of eight World Series (1963, 1965, 1966, 1974, 1977, 1978, 1981, and 1988). It also hosted the semifinals and finals of the 2009 World Baseball Classic as well as exhibition baseball during the 1984 Summer Olympics.
          The stadium hosted a soccer tournament on August 3, 2013 featuring four clubs, the hometown team Los Angeles Galaxy, and European giants Real Madrid, Everton, and Juventus.</p>
